## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:
- Java 17 or above installed
- MySQL database installed and running
- Maven installed

### Project Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/banking-app.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd banking-app
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

## Database Configuration

Configure the following properties in `src/main/resources/application.properties` to match your MySQL database setup:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/banking_app
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```

Make sure your MySQL database is running, and you have a schema named `banking_app`.

## API Endpoints

The application exposes the following RESTful API endpoints:

| HTTP Method | Endpoint               | Description                        |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| POST        | `/api/accounts`         | Create a new bank account          |
| GET         | `/api/accounts/{id}`    | Retrieve account details by ID     |
| PUT         | `/api/accounts/{id}/deposit` | Deposit funds into an account     |
| PUT         | `/api/accounts/{id}/withdraw` | Withdraw funds from an account   |
| GET         | `/api/accounts`         | Retrieve all accounts              |
| DELETE      | `/api/accounts/{id}`    | Delete an account by ID            |

### Sample JSON for Deposit and Withdraw Requests:
```json
{
  "amount": 1000.00
}
```

## How to Run

1. Ensure MySQL is running.
2. Run the application:

    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
3. Access the application using Postman or any other API testing tool to interact with the endpoints.
